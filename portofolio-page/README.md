Portfolio page implemented for Free Code Camp challenge. 
The design was not mine, but was inspired by https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-freelancer/.
The purpose of this page was not to test my designing skills, but rather my development skills so I implemented the design from scratch.
It was quite fun :).
